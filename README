Denotion:
	[the command] is a Linux command
	"file" is a file "folder/" is a folder

Code description:
There are 3 parts(folders) of codes. In folder "Gen" and "Cal" , Run11 and Run15 are seperated.

1 folder Gen:  get mudst from the server and build trees 
	[starver SL19c]
	[cvs co StRoot/StJetMake] [cvs co StRoot/StJetFinder/] somewhere else , overwrite them with my version in "Run11_new/StRoot/" and copy them back to "Run11_new/StRoot/" and "Run11_new/StRoot/".
	[cons]

	The job submission is fill-to-fill based for Run11 and period based  Run15. To submit a fill/period exec [submitFmsJetAna_stfms X] where X is a 5-digit fill number for Run11 and 1-digit period number(range from 1-9) for Run-15. To submit all fills in Run11, just exec [source Batchassort1]. For test purpose one can use 15315 for Run-11 and 0(for fill 18753,just created for test propose) for Run-15. After jobs done, use the template in "combine/" to merge the root files 

	Note: 
	1.1 Output files are directed to my local directory, one could change it in "RunFmsJetAna_stfms.xml"
	1.2 My output files are located in "/star/u/zwzhu/01zwzhu/Run11/byfill/" and "/star/u/zwzhu/01zwzhu/Run15/byfill/" which are used in next part as input.

2 folder Cal: calculate all the observable and save into text files
	There are 5 observables. To calculate each one, exec [submitAN] [submitIso] [submitPtAN] [submitjetAN] [submiColl]. To submit all 5, exec [source SubALL](not advisable, too many jobs submitting at one time could cause trouble.)

	Note:
	2.1 Default input directs to my local file, see Note 1.2. One could change the links in "forxmlfile".
	2.2 Output files are directed to my local directory, one could change them in those 5 xml files.
	2.3 My result files are stored in my local directory, which are used in next part to draw the final plots.
	

3 folder Draw:
	exec [source drawall] to get all the figures for the paper in Figures/
	Note:
	3.1 Some Root files ae stored in my local directory
