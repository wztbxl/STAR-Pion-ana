This is the folder to get dipi0 correlation in pp, pAu and pAl and produce the plots for the paper draft

First of all: 

**********************************************************************************************************
cvs co offline/paper/psn0777 into your space (YourSpace)
or you can copy the directory of /star/u/xchu/pwg/DiPion0Corr/psn0777/ into your space (YourSpace)

unzip StRoot.zip under Cal/pp, Cal/pAu1, Cal/pAu2, Cal/pAl
**********************************************************************************************************


**********************************************************************************************************
To avoid upload duplicated codes, all the same files I only uploaded one, so you need to copy some files into specific directory, do as follows: 

Copy /star/u/xchu/pwg/DiPion0Corr/psn0777/Cal/pp/StRoot/StFmsPointMaker/ into YourSpace/Cal/pAu1/StRoot/
Copy /star/u/xchu/pwg/DiPion0Corr/psn0777/Cal/pp/StRoot/StFmsPointMaker/ into YourSpace/Cal/pAu2/StRoot/
Copy /star/u/xchu/pwg/DiPion0Corr/psn0777/Cal/pp/StRoot/StFmsPointMaker/ into YourSpace/Cal/pAl/StRoot/

/star/u/xchu/pwg/DiPion0Corr/psn0777/Cal/pp/StRoot/StFmsPointMaker/ is needed for StRoot/ of pp, pAu1, pAu2 and pAl, they are the same, so you need to copy it from pp to other collision systems

Copy /star/u/xchu/pwg/DiPion0Corr/psn0777/Cal/pp/StRoot/StSpinPool/StFmsDiPi0/ into YourSpace/Cal/pAl/StRoot/StSpinPool/

/star/u/xchu/pwg/DiPion0Corr/psn0777/Cal/pp/StRoot/StSpinPool/StFmsDiPi0/ is needed for /StRoot/StSpinPool/ of pAl, pp and pAl are the same, so you need to copy it from pp to pAl
**********************************************************************************************************


Part1: Run macros from the directory Cal to get the dipi0 correlations in pp, pAu and pAl

****************** pp  ******************
1. Prepare a folder to store the output files for pp: YourDirectory/pp
to store the generated histgrams: YourDirectory/pp/Hist

2. cd Cal/pp/, open submit.xml, in line 9-11, revise "YourDiretory" into the one you want to use from step1.
3. Type stardev
4. Type cons 
	There will be a warnning: unused variable 'dsm' [-Wunused-variable], this varibale is used to do QA study but not dipi0 final analysis, so you can comment line220 in StRoot/StSpinPool/StTriggerStudyMaker.cxx, then this warnning will not show.

5. Type star-submit submit.xml

********** first period of pAu************ 
1. Prepare a folder to store the output files for pA1: YourDirectory/pAu1
to store the generated histgrams: YourDirectory/pAu1/Hist

2. cd Cal/pAu1/, open submit.xml, in line 9-11, revise "YourDiretory" into the one you want to use from step1.
3. repeat step 3-5 from pp collisions

********** second period of pAu************
1. Prepare a folder to store the output files for pA2: YourDirectory/pAu2

2. cd Cal/pAu2/, open submit.xml, in line 9-11, revise "YourDiretory" into the one you want to use from step1.
3. repeat step 3-5 from pp collisions

******************** pAl ******************
1. Prepare a folder to store the output files for pAl: YourDirectory/pAl

2. cd Cal/pAl/, open submit.xml, in line 9-11, revise "YourDiretory" into the one you want to use from step1.
3. repeat step 3-5 from pp collisions


Part2: Merge the output histgrams generated from Part1
1. cd YourDirectory/pp/Hist, type hadd pp.Hist.root *root 
2. cd YourDirectory/pAu1/Hist, type hadd pAu1.Hist.root *root 
3. cd YourDirectory/pAu2/Hist, type hadd pAu2.Hist.root *root 
4. cd YourDirectory/pAl/Hist, type hadd pAl.Hist.root *root 
5. Prerpare a folder to store pAu histgrams:YourDirectory/pAu/Hist, we merge pAu1.Hist.root and pAu2.Hist.root together into pAu.Hist.root, you can use hadd, and then save pAu.Hist.root at YourDirectory/pAu/Hist.
 

Part3: Enter the diretory Draw, obtain the fitting parameters from pp.Hist.root (pAu.Hist.root and pAl.Hist.root), the output txt files will be saved in the directory Draw/txt.
1. cd Draw, mkdir txt; mkdir plot
2. cd Draw, open dipi0.C, at line 282, 284 and 287, change "YourDirectory" into the path you used for part2. Then "run=11" refers to pp, "run=15" refers to pAu, "run=13" refers to pAl.
3. Type root -l 'dipi0.C(-41,2,11,4)' 
4. Type root -l 'dipi0.C(42,2,15,4)'
5. Type root -l 'dipi0.C(-42,15,15,4)'
6. Type root -l 'dipi0.C(43,2,13,4)'
After all done, you will get the parameter table in the directory of txt. You can have a comparsion of the txt files with those generated by Xiaoxuan Chu: /star/u/xchu/pwg/DiPion0Corr/Ana/Draw/txt


Part4: Draw plots in paperdraft:
1. Open f1.C, change "YourDirectory" into the one you used from part2.

Figures can be produced as the order:
2. Tpye root -l f1.C
3. Tpye root -l f2.C
4. Tpye root -l f3.C
5. Type root -l f4.C

Part5: Draw plots in Sumplement:
1. Open C_plot.C, change "YourDirectory" into the one you used from part2.
2. Type root -l C_plot.C
3. Type root -l sumSigma.C
4. Type root -l sumBkg.C
5. Type root -l sumArea.C
